Here is a Python-specific debugging document summary focusing on beginner-friendly techniques and tools:

## What is Python Debugging?
Python debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in Python code by examining its execution. The goal is to identify where things go wrong and understand why, so code can be corrected or improved.[1][2]

## Common Debugging Techniques in Python

### 1. Print Statements and Logging
- Using `print()` statements is the simplest form of debugging â€” insert prints to show variable values or execution points.
- Print statements should include context for clarity: `print(f"x is {x}")`.
- For more professional debugging, use Python's logging module (`import logging`) which provides levels, timestamps, and better control over output.[1]

### 2. Reading Error Messages
- Carefully read Python error tracebacks; they show the exact line and type of error.
- Understanding stack traces helps pinpoint the cause of failures quickly.[1]

### 3. Using Assertions
- Insert `assert` statements to check assumptions in code; these act like sanity checks during execution.
- When an assertion fails, it raises an informative error facilitating easier bug detection.[3][1]

## Using the Python Debugger (pdb)

### What is pdb?
- `pdb` is a built-in interactive debugger in Python that lets you set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and execute commands during runtime.[4][5]

### How to Use pdb
- Insert `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` into your script where you want to pause execution.
- Alternatively, use the built-in `breakpoint()` function starting from Python 3.7 for an easier call.[5][2]
- Run your program, and execution pauses at breakpoints showing a `(Pdb)` prompt.
- Common pdb commands:
  - `n` (next): execute the next line
  - `s` (step): step into a function call
  - `c` (continue): resume execution until the next breakpoint
  - `p <variable>`: print the value of a variable
  - `l` (list): show source code around current line
  - `b <linenumber>`: set a breakpoint
  - `q` (quit): quit debugger[6]

### Example Use
```python
import pdb

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

pdb.set_trace()  # Breakpoint here
x = 3
y = 5
result = add(x, y)
print(result)
```
When execution hits `set_trace()`, the debugger prompts appear to step through, inspect variables, and continue.[2][4]

## Debugging in IDEs (Optional)
- Many IDEs like PyCharm, VS Code, and Visual Studio provide graphical interfaces for Python debugging with breakpoints, call stacks, and variable inspection tools.
- Useful for richer debugging experiences beyond command-line pdb.[7][8][9]

## Summary Best Practices
- Start with print/log statements for quick insights.
- Learn to read Python tracebacks carefully.
- Use pdb and `breakpoint()` for interactive exploration.
- Consider assertions to catch unexpected states early.
- Use IDE debugging features when convenient.[2][1]
